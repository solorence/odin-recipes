    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Goat meat</li>
      <li>Catfish</li>
      <li>Dried prawns</li>
      <li>White yam</li>
      <li>Uziza leaves</li>
      <li>Locust beans (ogiri okpei, iru, dawadawa)</li>
      <li>Seasoning cubes; Maggi/Knorr
      <li>Crayfish</li>
      <li>Habanero peppers</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Wash and clean the goat meat, cut to desired chunks. Cut the catfish into thick chunks,  pour very hot water on the fish to wash off the slimy, drain the water, and set the fish aside. Place the goat meat in a cooking pot and pour enough water to cover the meat. Add the seasoning and cook till almost done. Then add the fish and cook till both meat and fish is done.</li>
      <li>While the meat is cooking, peel and cut the yam to little slices. Boil yam in a different pot till soft. When soft, pound with a mortar and pestle till it turns to a smooth paste, then set aside. Alternatively; you can substitute raw yam with yam powder or raw cocoyam or cocoyam powder.</li>
      <li>Blend the uziza leaves together with the chilli pepper and crayfish, set aside.</li>
      <li>When the meat and fish are almost done, add in the blended mixture and ogiri okpei. Now, stir-in add the yam paste in small lumps, stir and add salt to taste.</li>
      <li>Cover pot and allow to cook at high heat till all the yam paste dissolves and thickens the soup. Think that the yam paste will make the soup too thick? You can remove some the yam paste that are yet to dissolve. Or add little water to loosen soup.</li>
      <li>Your nsala soup is ready to be served with your favourite fufu – eba, semolina, amala, pounded yam etc.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
